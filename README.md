# Hi there, I'm Debdip Biswas 👋More actions

I am a passionate Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut (2023-27), with a keen interest in Fluid Mechanics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My goal is to apply my growing skills in simulation and programming to solve complex, real-world fluid dynamics challenges.

### 🔬 **Current Research**

My current work focuses on:
* Simulating the collapse of a static air bubble near a free surface using **Basilisk** for viscous Newtonian fluids. 
* Analyzing scaling behavior by studying the variation of bubble radius with time-to-collapse for different Bond numbers. 

---

### 🚀 **My Projects**

* **Bio-inspired Fish Propulsion for Underwater Robotics:** Created CAD models in **SolidWorks** and conducted CFD simulations using **ANSYS Fluent** to evaluate thrust performance. 
* **Study of Drift Velocity in Gravity Wave Fields:** Performed experiments in a wave tank and used **high-speed imaging** and **PIVlab (MATLAB)** to analyze the drift velocity of floating objects.
